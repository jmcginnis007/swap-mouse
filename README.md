# swap-mouse

## Description

Swaps mouse from right-handed to left-handed and vice versa.  Best way to use is to create a desktop shortcut to swapMouse.exe.  In that shortcut, set the "shortcut key" to Ctrl-Alt-M.  This will allow you switch back and forth by just hitting that key combination no matter what application you are in.  This is handy if you use a left-mouse but want to easily switch it to a righty mouse if someone else wants to drive for a little while.
